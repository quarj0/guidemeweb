      "This lesson uses the Iris dataset to demonstrate how to use the scikit-learn library to train a machine learning model. The programming language we'll use is Python. The Iris dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning. It contains 150 samples of three different species of Iris flowers. The dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of the flower. The dataset is available in the scikit-learn library. The scikit-learn library is a free machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms including support vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means, and DBSCAN. It also supports Python numerical and scientific libraries such as NumPy and SciPy. ",
