    question:
      "What is the output of the following code:\n\n```print(2 + 2 * 3)```",
    options: ["8", "10", "12", "14"],
    answer: "8",
    explanation:
      "The multiplication operator has higher precedence than the addition operator, so 2 * 3 is evaluated first, resulting in 6. Then 6 is added to 2, resulting in 8.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code:\n\n```x = 5\ny = 3\nprint(x > y)```",
    options: ["True", "False", "TypeError", "SyntaxError"],
    answer: "True",
    explanation:
      "The comparison operator `>` returns `True` if the left operand is greater than the right operand, and `False` otherwise. In this case, `x` is 5 and `y` is 3, so `x > y` is `True`.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code:\n\n```x = 'Python'\nprint(x[1:4])```",
    options: ["yth", "ytho", "yth", "ythn"],
    answer: "yth",
    explanation:
      "The string slice `x[1:4]` returns the substring starting at index 1 (inclusive) and ending at index 4 (exclusive) of the string `x`. In this case, those indices correspond to the characters 'y', 't', and 'h', so the output is 'yth'.",
  },
  {
    question: "Fill in the blank: Python is a _____ language.",
    options: ["compiled", "interpreted", "machine", "assembly"],
    answer: "interpreted",
    explanation:
      "Python is an interpreted language, which means that the source code is executed line by line by the Python interpreter, without the need for compilation into machine code.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code:\n\n```x = 5\nprint(f'The value of x is {x}')```",

      "The value of x is {x}",
      "The value of x is 'x'",
      "The value of x is {5}",
    ],
    answer: "The value of x is 5",
    explanation:
      "The f-string `f'The value of x is {x}'` evaluates the expression inside the curly braces and replaces it with its value. In this case, `x` is 5, so the output is 'The value of x is 5'.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code:\n\n```x = 5\ny = 3\nprint(x == y or x > y)```",
    options: ["True", "False", "TypeError", "SyntaxError"],
    answer: "True",
    explanation:
      "The logical operator `or` returns `True` if either of its operands is `True`, and `False` otherwise. In this case, `x == y` is `False` and `x > y` is `True`, so `x == y or x > y` is `True`.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nx = ['ab', 'cd']\nfor i in x:\n  i.upper()\nprint(x)",

      "['ab', 'cd']",
      "['Ab', 'Cd']",
      "This will throw an error",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "['ab', 'cd']",
    explanation:
      "The upper() method does not modify the original list. It returns a new string with all characters in uppercase. Since the strings in the list are not reassigned, the original list remains unchanged.",
  },

  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nx = ['ab', 'cd']\nfor i in x:\n  i.upper()\nprint(x)",

      "['ab', 'cd']",
      "['Ab', 'Cd']",
      "This will throw an error",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "['ab', 'cd']",

    options: ["10 20", "20 10", "0 20", "This will throw an error"],
    correctAnswer: "20 10",
    explanation:
      "This code demonstrates how to swap two variables without using a temporary variable. When we assign y, x to x, y, Python first creates a tuple (y, x) and then unpacks it to the variables x and y. So, x becomes 20 and y becomes 10.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nprint(2 ** 3 ** 2 ** 1)",
    options: ["8", "64", "512", "This will throw an error"],
    correctAnswer: "512",
    explanation:
      "The exponentiation operator (**) has right-to-left associativity in Python. So, 3 ** 2 ** 1 is equivalent to 3 ** (2 ** 1), which is 3 ** 2 = 9. Finally, 2 ** 9 = 512.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nx = [0, 1, 2, 3]\nprint(x[:-1])",
    options: [
      "[0, 1, 2]",
      "[1, 2, 3]",
      "[0, 1, 2, 3]",
      "This will throw an error",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "[0, 1, 2]",
    explanation:
      "Slicing a list with the notation x[start:stop:step] returns a new list containing elements from index start (inclusive) to index stop (exclusive), with a step size of step. If any of these values are omitted, they default to start=0, stop=len(x), step=1. So, x[:-1] means a slice of the list x that starts from the first element and goes up to (but does not include) the last element. In other words, it's the same as x[0:len(x)-1], which is [0, 1, 2].",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nx = 5\ny = 5\nprint(x is y)",
    options: [
      "True",
      "False",
      "This will throw an error",
      "It depends on the Python version",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "True",
    explanation:
      "In Python, small integers (between -5 and 256) are interned, which means they are stored in memory and reused. So, if two variables are assigned the same small integer, they will reference the same memory location. In this case, x and y are both assigned the integer 5, which is a small integer",
  },
  {
    question: "Which of the following is a valid Python variable name?",
    options: ["my-var", "my_var", "my var", "myvar"],
    correctAnswer: "my_var",
    explanation:
      "Variable names can contain letters, numbers, and underscores, but they cannot start with a number. Also, they are case-sensitive, so my_var and MY_VAR are two different variables.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "The following code will throw an error:\n\n```x = 5\nx = x + 1\nx += 1```",
    options: ["Line 2", "Line 3", "Both lines 2 and 3", "None of the lines"],
    correctAnswer: "Both lines 2 and 3",
    explanation:
      "The augmented assignment operator `+=` is equivalent to `x = x + 1`. So, the second and third lines are equivalent, and the code will throw an error.",
  },
  {
    question: "The wildcard character `_` can be used in Python to:",
    options: [
      "Ignore values in an unpacking operation",
      "Represent an unknown value",
      "Represent an unused variable",
      "All of the above",
    ],
    correctAnswer: "All of the above",
    explanation:
      "The underscore `_` is a special variable in Python that represents an unknown or unused value. It can be used in unpacking operations to ignore certain values, or as a placeholder for an unknown value.",

    question:
      "If python is installed on your computer, which of the following commands will open the Python interpreter?",
    options: ["`python`", "`python3`", "`py`", "All of the above"],
    correctAnswer: "All of the above",
    explanation:
      "The Python interpreter can be opened by running the `python` command in the terminal. If you have both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, you can run `python3` to open the Python 3 interpreter. The `py` command is specific to Windows and will open the Python interpreter associated with the `.py` file extension.",

  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nx = 1\ny = 1\nx == y is True",
    options: ["True", "False", "TypeError", "SyntaxError"],
    correctAnswer: "True",
    explanation:
      "The `is` operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. In this case, x and y both point to the integer 1, which is a small integer that is interned. So, `x == y is True` is equivalent to `True is True`, which is `True`.",
  },
  {
    question:
      "What is the output of the following code?\n\nx = 1\ny = 1.0\nx == y is True",
    options: ["True", "False", "TypeError", "SyntaxError"],
    correctAnswer: "False",
    explanation:
      "The `is` operator checks if two variables point to the same object in memory. In this case, x points to the integer 1, which is a small integer that is interned, while y points to the float 1.0, which is not interned. So, `x == y is True` is equivalent to `False is True`, which is `False`.",
  },

    options: ["`3`", "`12`", "`SyntaxError`", "`NameError`"],
    correctAnswer: "`3`",
    explanation:
      "The `python` command will run the specified Python file. In this case, `quiz.py` contains the code `x = 1\ny = 2\nprint(x + y)`, which will print the sum of x and y, which is 3.",
