      <h2>Python Syntax</h2>
      <p>Python code is executed line by line, from top to bottom. Here are some basic syntax rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python statements do not need to end with a semicolon (;), unlike many other programming languages.</li>
        <li>Indentation is important in Python. Blocks of code are defined by their indentation level, typically four spaces or a tab character.</li>
        <li>Comments in Python start with the pound (#) character and continue to the end of the line.</li>
        <li>Variables in Python do not need to be declared with a specific data type. They are dynamically typed and their type is inferred based on the value assigned to them.</li>
        <li>Strings in Python can be enclosed in single quotes ('...') or double quotes ("...").</li>
        <li>Python has several built-in data types, including integers, floating point numbers, complex numbers, strings, lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.</li>
        <li>Python supports arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %, //, **) for numeric types, as well as comparison operators (==, !=, &gt;, &gl;, &gt;=, &gl;=) and logical operators (and, or, not).</li>
        <li>Control flow statements in Python include if/else statements, for loops, while loops, and try/except blocks for error handling.</li>
        <li>Functions in Python are defined using the "def" keyword and can take parameters and return values.</li>
        <li>Python has a large standard library of modules for a variety of tasks, as well as a vast ecosystem of third-party packages.</li>
      </ul>
